## Does entity annotations have an impact 
## on the word embedding training process?

In my bachelor thesis I trained embeddings from raw text (word embeddings) and from entity annotated text (entity embeddings) with [gensim's word2vec libary](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html) and evaluated them with word related tasks and entity tasks afterwords in order to answer following question:

                      Does entity annotations have an impact on the word embedding training process?
